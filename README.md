# CountdownGame
2 users to play “Java Keyword Countdown”. The game is similar to the TV show Countdown but in this instance, the user can’t just make any word, they must make a java keyword. Each player enters their word in turn and then the game checks that each word is a valid java term and then if both are valid, it compares the two words to see which is longest. The player with the longest valid word wins the round and gets a point.
